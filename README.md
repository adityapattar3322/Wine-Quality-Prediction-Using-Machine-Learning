# Wine Quality Prediction

Wine Quality Prediction is a research-driven project aimed at predicting the quality of wine using chemical properties such as pH, acidity, and alcohol content. This project employs data analysis and machine learning techniques to derive insights and build predictive models.

## What the Project Does

This project is designed to:
- Analyze chemical property data of wine to predict its quality.
- Use machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate prediction models.
- Provide a foundation for further research in wine quality assessment and enhancement.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data analysis and implementation of machine learning algorithms)
- **NumPy, Pandas** (for data manipulation and preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for training and evaluating machine learning models)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive exploration and documentation of results)

## Key Features
- **Data-Driven Approach:** Uses historical wine data for insights and model training.
- **Model Evaluation:** Includes performance metrics to assess model accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Offers clear and concise visual representations of data trends and model results.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Wine_Quality_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Load the dataset and follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a stepping stone for research in predicting wine quality and can be extended or refined for commercial or academic purposes.
