” Wine is the most healthful and most hygienic of beverages “
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics. 
By analyzing the physiochemical properties of wine, we aim to provide an efficient and automated way to assess wine quality.
